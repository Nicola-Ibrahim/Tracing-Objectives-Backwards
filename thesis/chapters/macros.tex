%% Chapter-specific macros
%
% You can define additional shorthand notations here which are local to the
% chapters of your thesis.  These macros complement the global definitions in
% `../macros.tex`.  Feel free to modify or extend this file.  Prefix your
% macros to avoid accidental clashes with package commands.

% Example: small O notation
\newcommand{\bigO}{\mathcal{O}}
